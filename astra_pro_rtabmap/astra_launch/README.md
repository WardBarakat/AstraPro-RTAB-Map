Make Sure to go into astrapro.launch and processing.launch files and change the lines below to your directory. 
  <include file="/home/ward/catkin_ws/src/astra_pro_rtabmap/astra_launch/processing.launch">

file="/home/ward/catkin_ws/src/astra_pro_rtabmap/astra_launch/astra_frames.launch">

file="/home/ward/catkin_ws/src/astra_pro_rtabmap/astra_launch/rgb.launch">

as you can see it says "ward" so you must change it to what your computer name is instead. 


thanks for reading :)
